    <h1>Why the Sun Shines When It's Raining</h1>
    <p>The Magical Phenomenon of Sunshowers Explained</p>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>Have you ever seen it rain while the sun is still shining?</strong> This breathtaking moment, known as a <em>sunshower</em>, might feel like nature is playing tricks—but it’s a real, explainable weather event that amazes people across the world.</p>

    <h2>🌦️ What is a Sunshower?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>sunshower</strong> is a weather condition where rain falls while the sun is still shining brightly. It typically occurs when the sun is low in the sky and rain is falling from a cloud far away from the sun's position. Despite the rainfall, the sky remains partially clear, allowing sunlight to pass through.</p>

    <h2>☀️ Why Does the Sun Shine During Rain?</h2>
    <p>The main reason lies in how rain clouds and sunlight behave. Rain is usually produced by cumulonimbus or nimbostratus clouds. If wind blows the rainclouds slightly ahead of your position, and the sun is still behind you, sunlight can still reach your area while it rains. This happens more often in tropical and humid climates.</p>

    <h2>🌈 Sunshowers and Rainbows</h2>
    <p>Sunshowers are also responsible for the formation of beautiful rainbows. When sunlight shines through raindrops at the right angle (about 42°), it refracts and reflects inside the drop, creating a rainbow. This is why you often see rainbows right after or even during a sunshower.</p>

    <h2>🌍 Sunshower Legends & Folklore</h2>
    <p>Many cultures around the world have unique interpretations of sunshowers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>India:</strong> It’s said that foxes are getting married when it rains and the sun shines.</li>
      <li><strong>Japan:</strong> Folklore calls it a “Kitsune no Yomeiri” (fox wedding), a mysterious or spiritual moment.</li>
      <li><strong>Africa:</strong> Some tribes believe it means the devil is fighting with his wife.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔬 The Science Behind It</h2>
    <p>Sunshowers are possible because sunlight travels in straight lines and can reach through breaks in clouds. If the sun is not obstructed by clouds near the horizon and the rain is from a cloud that’s drifting away from the sun, you get both rain and sun simultaneously. Modern weather radars can even predict sunshowers based on cloud movement and sunlight angle.</p>

    <h2>🌤️ Are Sunshowers Common?</h2>
    <p>They’re more common than you might think—especially in places with fast-changing weather like coastal regions or tropical countries like India, Indonesia, and Brazil. In India, during monsoons, it's not unusual to experience short bursts of rain while the sun is still visible.</p>

    <h2>📸 How to Capture a Sunshower</h2>
    <p>If you ever spot a sunshower, it’s a great opportunity for photography. The lighting is soft and golden, and the contrast of rain with sunlight often leads to dramatic visuals. Set your camera to high shutter speed to catch the falling raindrops and include foreground objects like trees or people for depth.</p>

    <h2>✅ Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Sunshowers are one of nature’s most surprising and beautiful events. Now that you know the science behind this magical mix of sunshine and rain, you’ll never look at it the same way again. Next time you see it, don’t just run for shelter—pause, enjoy, and maybe even look out for a rainbow.</p>
