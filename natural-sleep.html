      <h2>Why Natural Sleep Aids?</h2>
      <p>With more people facing sleep disruptions in 2025, there's growing interest in safe, natural solutions that don’t involve dependency or side effects. Fortunately, science supports several natural remedies that can significantly improve sleep quality.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Top Science-Backed Natural Sleep Aids</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Melatonin:</strong> A hormone naturally produced by the pineal gland, melatonin supplements can reset your internal clock, especially after travel or irregular schedules.</li>
        <li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Research shows magnesium glycinate or citrate can calm the nervous system, promoting deeper sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Valerian Root:</strong> Used for centuries, clinical studies suggest valerian reduces the time it takes to fall asleep and improves sleep quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Lavender:</strong> Aromatherapy and oral lavender oil capsules have shown measurable effects on reducing anxiety and improving sleep scores.</li>
        <li><strong>L-Theanine:</strong> An amino acid found in green tea, L-theanine supports alpha brain waves and a relaxed but alert state — ideal for sleep prep.</li>
        <li><strong>Glycine:</strong> A small dose of this amino acid before bed can lower body temperature and improve sleep latency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Daily Habits That Support Better Sleep</h2>
      <p>In addition to supplements, building healthy sleep habits makes a big difference. Stick to a consistent bedtime, reduce blue light exposure in the evening, avoid caffeine after 2 p.m., and wind down with meditation or reading.</p>

      <h2>Precautions</h2>
      <p>Always consult a healthcare provider before starting supplements, especially if you're pregnant, nursing, or taking medication. Natural doesn’t always mean risk-free.</p>
