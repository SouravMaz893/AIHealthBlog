      <h2>What is the Gut-Brain Axis?</h2>
      <p>The gut-brain axis is the bidirectional communication system between your gut microbiome and your brain. It involves neural, hormonal, and immune signals — and it’s revolutionizing how we approach mental health in 2025.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Your Gut Affects Mental Health</h2>
      <p>Over 90% of serotonin — the “feel-good” neurotransmitter — is produced in the gut. Imbalances in gut bacteria have been linked to anxiety, depression, mood swings, and even brain fog. A healthy gut leads to a balanced mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Nutrients and Probiotics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Probiotics:</strong> Strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium improve mood and reduce stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Prebiotics:</strong> Found in garlic, onions, and bananas, they fuel the good bacteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids:</strong> Anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermented Foods:</strong> Yogurt, kimchi, kefir, and sauerkraut promote gut diversity.</li>
        <li><strong>Polyphenols:</strong> Found in berries, green tea, and cocoa — they support beneficial microbes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Daily Habits That Boost the Gut-Brain Axis</h2>
      <p>Eat more fiber, avoid processed foods, stay hydrated, manage stress with yoga or breathwork, and get quality sleep. A consistent routine keeps both your gut and mind in balance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future of Mental Health: Gut-Centric Therapies</h2>
      <p>In 2025, psychiatrists are increasingly collaborating with nutritionists to prescribe dietary changes alongside medications. Fecal transplants, psychobiotics, and microbiome testing are emerging tools in personalized mental wellness plans.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>The gut is more than a digestive organ — it’s your second brain. Supporting your microbiome could be the missing link to emotional resilience and mental clarity. Welcome to the new frontier of holistic mental health.</p>
