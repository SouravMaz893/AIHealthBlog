      <h2>1. Personalized Learning with AI</h2>
      <p>
        Every student learns at their own pace. AI-powered platforms can now adapt lessons based on the student's understanding, learning style, and progress.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smart Content</strong> – Tools like <em>Quizlet</em> and <em>Socratic</em> create AI-generated flashcards, quizzes, and summaries based on course material.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive Learning Systems</strong> – Platforms like <em>DreamBox</em> or <em>Century Tech</em> tailor learning paths to individual student needs.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Tutors</strong> – Chatbots and intelligent tutors provide 24/7 academic support in subjects like math, coding, and science.</li>
      </ul>
