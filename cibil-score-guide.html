    <h2>ðŸ“… 7 Actionable Steps to Improve CIBIL Score in 3 Months</h2>

    <h3>1. Pay All EMIs and Credit Card Bills on Time</h3>
    <p>Payment history makes up 35% of your credit score. Set reminders or auto-pay options to avoid delays.</p>

    <h3>2. Reduce Credit Utilization Below 30%</h3>
    <p>If your credit card limit is â‚¹1,00,000, try to use less than â‚¹30,000 at any time. This shows you're not over-relying on credit.</p>

    <h3>3. Donâ€™t Apply for Multiple Loans at Once</h3>
    <p>Each application creates a hard inquiry, which lowers your score temporarily. Space out your applications.</p>

    <h3>4. Use a Secured Credit Card</h3>
    <p>If your score is low, get a secured credit card backed by a fixed deposit. It builds credit without major risk.</p>

    <h3>5. Check Your CIBIL Report for Errors</h3>
    <p>Visit <a href="https://www.cibil.com/" target="_blank">cibil.com</a> to get one free report per year. Dispute any incorrect entries online.</p>

    <h3>6. Avoid Closing Old Credit Accounts</h3>
    <p>Old accounts add to your credit history length, which boosts your score. Keep them open even if unused.</p>

    <h3>7. Diversify Credit Types</h3>
    <p>Use a mix of secured (home loan) and unsecured (credit card) credit. It improves your score in the long run.</p>
