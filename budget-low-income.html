  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Living on a ₹15,000 monthly salary might seem tough, but with smart planning, it’s absolutely possible to save. Whether you're a student, an entry-level employee, or a freelancer, you can manage your money better with simple budgeting techniques.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Know Where Your Money Goes</h2>

    <li>Groceries</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
    <li>Utilities (Electricity, Internet, Phone)</li>
    <li>Personal & Miscellaneous</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Create a Monthly Budget Plan</h2>
  <p>Here's an example budget for ₹15,000/month:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rent/Room: ₹4,000</li>
    <li>Food & Groceries: ₹3,000</li>
    <li>Transport: ₹1,000</li>
    <li>Utilities & Phone: ₹1,000</li>

    <li>Buy second-hand when possible (books, clothes)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: Use Savings Wisely</h2>
  <p>Don't just save, grow your money:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open a recurring deposit (RD)</li>
    <li>Use apps like Jar or Piggy to invest micro-savings</li>
    <li>Start an SIP with just ₹500/month</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 5: Look for Extra Income</h2>
  <p>If possible, boost your income through part-time work or freelancing. Some ideas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Content writing, tutoring, or data entry</li>
    <li>Sell handmade crafts, snacks, or used items online</li>
    <li>Monetize skills on Fiverr or Upwork</li>
  </ul>
