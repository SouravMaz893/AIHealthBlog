    <h2>Why Freelancers Must Prioritize Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>In 2025, freelancing is booming—but so are cyber threats. From phishing to client impersonation, freelancers are prime targets due to limited IT support and reliance on cloud tools. Whether you're a designer, writer, marketer, or developer, your personal security is your professional shield.</p>

    <h2>Essential Security Tools for Freelancers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bitwarden:</strong> A secure, open-source password manager to safely store credentials across devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Mullvad VPN:</strong> Privacy-first VPN with no personal data required to sign up, ideal for secure browsing and Wi-Fi protection.</li>
      <li><strong>YubiKey:</strong> Hardware-based two-factor authentication that protects against phishing and password theft.</li>
      <li><strong>Signal:</strong> End-to-end encrypted messaging for safe communication with clients and collaborators.</li>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Daily Security Practices to Adopt</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use unique, complex passwords for every login—never reuse them.</li>
      <li>Back up important files to encrypted cloud storage and/or external drives.</li>
      <li>Avoid public Wi-Fi or always use a VPN when accessing sensitive accounts.</li>
      <li>Keep your OS, browsers, and plugins updated to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication) on all platforms, especially email and payment apps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bonus Tip: Protect Your Online Reputation</h2>
    <p>Freelancers often underestimate how personal branding can be exploited. Regularly Google yourself, monitor unusual logins, and keep social media accounts private or professional. Tools like <strong>Have I Been Pwned</strong> help check if your email or passwords have been leaked in past data breaches.</p>
