      <h2>Understanding Chronic Fatigue</h2>
      <p>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is more than just feeling tired — it's a complex condition that affects the body, mind, and energy systems. In 2025, as more people seek natural and integrative solutions, holistic healing methods are gaining attention as alternatives to traditional medical approaches.</p>

      <h2>Why Go Holistic?</h2>
      <p>Holistic healing looks at the person as a whole — addressing physical symptoms, mental well-being, lifestyle, and spiritual balance. Unlike medications that often only target symptoms, holistic methods aim to restore overall energy and vitality.</p>
